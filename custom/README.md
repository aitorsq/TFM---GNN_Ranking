# Experiment: Synthetic graphs performance

1 - execute the exp_1_generate_graphs.py with the desired parameters (num of graphs generated, max-min nodes etc)
2 - execute the exp_1_create_datasets.py with the parameters(adj_size desired, num of train, test and copy)
3 - execute the exp_1_graphs_performance.py - introducing the synthetic type desired, the process will start taking the graphs generated by the two previous steps

we can repeat the process with different configurations:
Included into the memory:
    variations on number of replications (1, 2, 10,20, 40) (when considering 5 training so it means, 5, 10, 50, 100, 200 graphs)

# Experiment: REAL graphs performance

we repeat a similar process
generate 5 graphs for training (10000 nodes (they use 100000 nodes)) and use them for training
exp_2_generate_graphs
exp_2_create_datasets
